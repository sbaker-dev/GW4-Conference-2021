            Currently some of the only data available is from public health england when looking historically, which
            only gives the total values for the whole of england and wales annually, making it fairly useless for
            investigating individual level exposures. Its also annual, which given many disease have seasons and strong
            time trends, makes it difficult to investigating within year effects.

        <p class="page_g3 body_text" style="text-align: justify">
            Weekly data exists, but has never been digitised, and of the shelf software just wouldn't work given the
            level of work required, with the cost of manually transcribing this data costing 10's of thousands of pounds.

            By using open computer vision and python, a new software package called ArchiveOCR was programmed to handel
            this task. Using it, we where to digitise the core parts of these tables to around a 99.4% accuracy to give
            us detailed data on disease exposure from 1941-74.

            Archive OCR isn't yet release to the public, as its unfinished and hard to use. However, one day it will
            be release and that will be its own contribution.

            to investigate a broad range of questions, but also perseveres detailed information at risk of being lost

            Districts change over time, and this can lead to difficulties when trying to investigated within district
            estimations over time. To solve this, <a class="page_g2" href="https://github.com/sbaker-dev/weightGIS">weightGIS</a> was
            developed to standardise places over time. Given most of the data that we will be using in our analysis
            is from the UK Biobank, we standardise the data to the 1951 census giving 1472 districts.

            We then linked each individual in the UK Biobank to these districts based on the year and month of their
            birth, but also to all other geographic levels for future data mergers

        <p class="page_g3 body_text" style="text-align: justify">
            Whilst the hygiene hypothesis has long since been disprove, with the inverse relation between declining
            disease cases and increasing atopic disease now being found to be a very complex relationship from multiple
            changing environments.

            However, diseases environments changes significantly and many papers disproving their contribution do not
            consider genetics. Given atopic diseases are highly heritable, it is possible that the impact of early life
            infection may change later life outcomes conditional on their genetic endowment. Here we generalise
            infection rates to individuals in the UK Biobank based on their districts of birth as the exposure and
            investigated there impact on asthma.

            Preliminary results show that whilst when simply looking at the impact of early life infection on asthma
            there are inconstant results or none as par the literature currently, when interacting with an individuals
            polygenic score for asthma scarlet fever and pertussis exposures in early life are association with reduced
            asthma instance later in life.

        <p class="page_g3 body_text" style="text-align: justify">
            Streptococcus pyogenes has multiple disease outcomes, many of which have currently established long term
            consequences from childhood infections. Acute rheumatic fever leads to rheumatic heart disease, and the ASO
            anti-body response from infection has been linked to later life Crohns disease, narcolepsy,
            henoch-schoen purural, psoriasis and PANDAS.

            Most of these studies however use very small samples, where as we generalise infection rates of scarlet
            fever as the underlying prevalence of S. Pyogenes based on the district of birth of the UK Biobank
            individuals. Here we focus on cardiovascular health, given the prior known abdications with rhumatic heart
            disease. We find associations of increased exposures to scarlet fever on increase levels of heart disease.

        <p class="page_g3 body_text" style="text-align: justify">
            Many diseases, espically childhood diseases, have recived little attention in GWAS studies. This is mostly
            due to a lack of data, one of the only GWAS on notifiable disease uses
            <a class="page_g2" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00257-5">self reported data from 23andMe(Tian et al 2017).</a>
            An alternative is to generalise infection exposure from generalise infection rates to individuals in the UK
            Biobank based on their districts of birth. Preliminary results of measles finds a similar results as Tian et al (2017)
            with no significant hits, if expand and validated this could represet an affordable way to investigate a first
            stage of diseases.
